SOSiG Operating System is Great (SOSiG) is a hobby operating system for the
Raspberry Pi 3, and probably some other SoC's in the future.

I have no idea what I'm doing, so if you decide to use this code you're
doing so at your own risk.  I am not responsible for crashed systems, damaged
hardware, loss of spatial orientation, loss of offical ranks or titles, fever,
dry mouth, or the return of Jim.
